* Once your new project is created, click the cog icon next to Project Overview to access your project settings.

* Click the button that says "Add Firebase to your web app" and copy the information from the modal window that pops up.

* Create a file called `api-keys.ts` in the `src/app/` directory and add the following code with your API key information in place of the 'xxx's:
```
export var masterFirebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "xxxx",
  authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseUrl: "https://xxx.firebaseio.com",
  storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",
  messageingSenderId: "xxxx"
};
```
